# INTRODUCTION

# A little bit about myself

Hello my name is Luis Alberto Sosa, Born in México and living in Toronto ON right now. I graduated from system computer engineer career at Instituto Politécnico Nacional university, México, in 2013, and now I am studying an A.I. postgraduate program at [George Brown College](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/applied-ai-solutions-development-program-postgraduate-t431).

I also like to do videogame programming on my free time, using Unity 3D engine. 

# Professional life

During my professional life I have worked in diferent fields regarding computer programming, starting as a tester for a mexican bank: [Citi Banamex](https://www.banamex.com/), Then i was promoted to an analyst position in the same copmany.

After that, I started my Business Intelligence career at another Mexican bank: [Banjercito](https://www.gob.mx/banjercito#9977) using Qliktech software (Qlik view, Qlik sense, Qlik scrip module), Helping to create dashboards for business areas such as marketing, credit and sales. This was my first approach to BI and ETL development areas.

Because i like videogame programming too, my next job was in an small company called [WTRON](https://www.w-tron.com.mx/) as a Unity 3D video game programmer, my role was to develop marketing applications and small games for both mobile and desktop, using Unity engine, and also publish them on google playstore and apple appstore.

Some of the apps i developed:

-[AR using Vuforia and Unity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.WTLabs.DazAR)

-[Videogame using AR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.WTron.EventoDaz)

Before my current job, i worked in a mexican institute for 3 years which does auctions for all public called [INDEP](https://www.gob.mx/indep). I had the opportunity of being the manager of a small team of business intelligence specialists, directing a handful of BI developments, attending meetings with directive areas and showing Power BI dashboards to them. Also, we implemented some basic machine learning solutions like a recommendation dashboard that helped the marketing area to identify customers and send them personalized emails. This was my first approach to machine learning.

Lastly, my current job is being an ETL senior consultant for a American company called [Uniform Advantage](https://www.uniformadvantage.com/), I have been doing ETL processes and dashboards to help the business areas to gain insights about our clients and also business processes and develop marketing campaings and improve the overall performance 

# Machine learning projects

[Recommendation using spark ALS](https://github.com/nepluis/Machine-learning-Repo/tree/main/ML%20projects/Recommendation)

Recommendation project me and my work companions did for my older company, the problem to solve was that the marketing area needed to update their website and create email campaigns more personalized to the users (like some popular e-commerce sites), so we used as the source data all the sales from 5 years and trained a machine learning model using SPARK ALS to get recommendations for both users and products. Lastly, we used the output data to create a Power BI dashboard for the area to use and search the customer information (email, state, etc.)

[Help Desk multi classifier using NN](https://github.com/nepluis/Machine-learning-Repo/tree/main/ML%20projects/Classifiers/Help_desk_multi_classifier)

One of my first practices using Tensorflow and Keras, The problem to solve was that the help desk area was being overwhelmed with issues from users from the company and they manually needed to read each request to determine which area should take care of it, so this model used NN and NLP to automatically classify each request and determine the corresponding area to attend the issue.

[Classification using Random Forest](https://github.com/nepluis/Machine-learning-Repo/tree/main/ML%20projects/Classifiers/Game_ratings_classifier)

Project for my George Brown College Math class.
Basic classification model using Random Forest to classify games genres using the following kaggle data source:

[NLP Practices](https://github.com/nepluis/Machine-learning-Repo/tree/main/ML%20projects/NLP)

Some basic NLP practices that I did when starting into processing data, these ones use functions like bigrams, remove stopwords and so on to clean text from different sources and do basic analysis on the results.
