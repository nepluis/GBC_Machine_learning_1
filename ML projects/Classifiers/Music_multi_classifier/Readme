Project for George Brown Deep learning class.

This is a multiclassifier using Neural networks and both thecniques label encoding and One HOt encoding to compare results for accuracy.

The data set used was (GTZAN dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/activity]

I used the code from this (article)[https://blog.clairvoyantsoft.com/music-genre-classification-using-cnn-ef9461553726] as a base and add the One Hot encoding part and also the get features part for test new songs.
